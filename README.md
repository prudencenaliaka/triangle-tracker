# TRIANGLE TRACKER
#### By **PRUDENCE NALIAKA**
I am a computer science student in kabarak university,i'll be going to second year in two months time and i got passion in coding.
## Project Description
The project is about a triangular track that will help us identify the type of triangle it is,if to say all sides are found equal then it is equilateral,two sides equal then it is isosceles and if none of the sides are equal then it is scalene,the triangular tracker is also based on the fact that the if sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side then a triangle can't be formed.
## Setup/Installation Requirements
* incorporation of HTML input fields.
* use of graphical user interface.
* appropriate control flows to be used.
* ensure sum of two sides of triangle is not equal to or less than the third remaining side.
* use a good CSS stylsheet.

## BDD
specifications
 when all sides are equal output is equilateral
 when two of the sides are equal output is isosceles
 when all the three sides are not equal output is scalene
 when two of the sides are less than or equal to the third side the output is not a triangle
we input values then evaluate them to get results
